 SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS, TEACHERS AND
STAFF
Key Messages & Actions
Basic principles
Following basic principles can help keep students, teachers, and staff safe at school and help stop the
spread of this disease. Recommendations for healthy schools are:
• Sick students, teachers and other staff should not come to school
• Schools should enforce regular hand washing with safe water and soap, alcohol rub/hand
sanitizer or chlorine solution and, at a minimum, daily disinfection and cleaning of school
surfaces
• Schools should provide water, sanitation and waste management facilities and follow
environmental cleaning and decontamination procedures
• Schools should promote social distancing (a term applied to certain actions that are taken to
slow down the spread of a highly contagious disease, including limiting large groups of people
coming together)
Know the latest facts
Understand basic information about coronavirus disease (COVID-19), including its symptoms,
complications, how it is transmitted and how to prevent transmission. Stay informed about COVID-19
through reputable sources such as UNICEF, WHO and national health ministry advisories. Be aware
of fake information/myths that may circulate by word-of-mouth or online.
Ensure safe school operations
See ‘Checklist on Safe School Environments’ below
Update or develop school emergency and contingency plans. Work with officials to guarantee schools
are not used as shelters, treatment units, etc. Consider cancelling any community events/meetings
that usually take place on school premises, based on risk.
Reinforce frequent handwashing and sanitation and procure needed supplies. Prepare and maintain
handwashing stations with soap and water, and if possible, place alcohol-based hand rub (hand
sanitizers) in each classroom, at entrances and exits, and near lunchrooms and toilets.
Clean and disinfect school buildings, classrooms and especially water and sanitation facilities at least
once a day, particularly surfaces that are touched by many people (railings, lunch tables, sports
equipment, door and window handles, toys, teaching and learning aids etc.)
Implement social distancing practices that may include:
• Staggering the beginning and end of the school day
• Cancelling assemblies, sports games and other events that create crowded conditions
• When possible, create space for children’s desks to be at least one metre apart
• Teach and model creating space and avoiding unnecessary touching Establish procedures if students or staff become unwell
Plan ahead with local health authorities, school health staff and update emergency contact lists.
Ensure a procedure for separating sick students and staff from those who are well – without creating
stigma – and a process for informing parents/caregivers, and consulting with health care
providers/health authorities wherever possible. Students/staff may need to be referred directly to a
health facility, depending on the situation/context, or sent home. Share procedures with staff, parents
and students ahead of time.

Promote information sharing
Coordinate and follow guidelines from the national health and education authorities. Share known
information with staff, caregivers and students, providing updated information on the disease situation,
including prevention and control efforts at school. Reinforce that caregivers should alert the school and
health care authorities if someone in their home has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and keep their
child at home. Utilize parent-teacher committees and other mechanisms to promote information
sharing. Also be sure to address children’s questions and concerns, including through the
development of child-friendly materials such as posters which can be placed on notice boards, in
restrooms, and other central locations.
Adapt school policies where appropriate
Develop flexible attendance and sick leave policies that encourage students and staff to stay home
when sick or when caring for sick family members. Discourage the use of perfect attendance awards
and incentives. Identify critical job functions and positions, and plan for alternative coverage by cross-
training staff. Plan for possible academic calendar changes, particularly in relation to breaks and
exams.
Monitor school attendance
Implement school absenteeism monitoring systems to track student and staff absence and compare
against usual absenteeism patterns at the school. Alert local health authorities about large increases in
student and staff absenteeism due to respiratory illnesses.
Plan for continuity of learning
In the case of absenteeism/sick leave or temporary school closures, support continued access to
quality education. This can include:
• Use of online/e-learning strategies
• Assigning reading and exercises for home study
• Radio, podcast or television broadcasts of academic content
• Assigning teachers to conduct remote daily or weekly follow up with students
• Review/develop accelerated education strategies
Implement targeted health education
Integrate disease prevention and control in daily activities and lessons. Ensure content is age-,
gender-, ethnicity-, and disability-responsive and activities are built into existing subjects. (See Section
on Age-Appropriate Health Education)</p>
