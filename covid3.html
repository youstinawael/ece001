<p><font coLor="white">What to do to protect yourself and others from COVID-19


 Keep a distance of at least 1 meter from others to reduce the risk of infection when they cough, sneeze or speak. Keep an even greater distance from others when indoors. The greater the distance, the better.

 Make it a habit to wear a mask when you are with other people. Proper use, preservation, cleaning and disposal of masks is essential to make them as effective as possible.

 Here is the basic information on how to wear a mask:


 Clean your hands before putting on the mask, and before and after taking it off.

 Make sure it covers your nose, mouth and chin.

 When you remove the mask, keep it in a clean plastic bag, and make sure to wash it daily if it is a cloth mask, or dispose of it in the waste bin if it is a medical mask.

 Do not use masks with valves.

 For more details on what type of mask to wear and when to wear it, please see the Q&A section and watch the videos on our website. There are also questions and answers that focus on masks and children.

 To learn more scientific information about the way a person becomes infected with COVID-19 and the way our bodies react, please watch or read this interview.

 For specific advice to decision makers, please see FAO's Technical Guidelines.

 How to make your environment safer


 Avoid all three memes: enclosed, crowded, or close contact.

 Outbreaks are reported in restaurants, choir rehearsals, fitness classes, nightclubs, offices, places of worship where people gather, and often in crowded enclosed spaces where people are loudly talking, yelling, breathing heavily or singing.

 The risk of contracting COVID-19 increases in crowded, poorly ventilated spaces where infected people spend long periods of time together in close proximity to each other. It is these environments in which the virus appears to spread more efficiently via respiratory droplets or aerosols, so precautions are more important.

 Meet people outside. Outdoor gatherings are safer than indoor gatherings, especially if the indoor spaces are small and do not get outside air.</p>
