INTRODUCTION
The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been declared a Public Health Emergency of
International Concern (PHEIC) and the virus has now spread to many countries and territories. While a lot
is still unknown about the virus that causes COVID-19, we do know that it is transmitted through direct
contact with respiratory droplets of an infected person (generated through coughing and sneezing)
Individuals can also be infected from touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and touching their
face (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth). While COVID-19 continues to spread it is important that communities take
action to prevent further transmission, reduce the impacts of the outbreak and support control measures.
The protection of children and educational facilities is particularly important. Precautions are necessary to
prevent the potential spread of COVID-19 in school settings; however, care must also be taken to avoid
stigmatizing students and staff who may have been exposed to the virus. It is important to remember that
COVID-19 does not differentiate between borders, ethnicities, disability status, age or gender. Education
settings should continue to be welcoming, respectful, inclusive, and supportive environments to all.
Measures taken by schools can prevent the entry and spread of COVID-19 by students and staff who may
have been exposed to the virus, while minimizing disruption and protecting students and staff from
discrimination.
Purpose
Today, children and young people are global citizens, powerful agents of change and the next generation
of caregivers, scientists, and doctors. Any crisis presents the opportunity to help them learn, cultivate
compassion and increase resilience while building a safer and more caring community. Having
information and facts about COVID-19 will help diminish students’ fears and anxieties around the disease
and support their ability to cope with any secondary impacts in their lives. This guidance provides key
messages and considerations for engaging school administrators, teachers and staff, parents, caregivers
and community members, as well as children themselves in promoting safe and healthy schools.
The purpose of this document is to provide clear and actionable guidance for safe operations through the
prevention, early detection and control of COVID-19 in schools and other educational facilities. The
guidance, while specific to countries that have already confirmed the transmission of COVID-19, is still
relevant in all other contexts. Education can encourage students to become advocates for disease
prevention and control at home, in school, and in their community by talking to others about how to
prevent the spread of viruses. Maintaining safe school operations or reopening schools after a closure
requires many considerations but, if done well, can promote public health.</p>
