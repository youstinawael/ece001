Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.

The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. 

The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette</p>

FACTS ABOUT COVID-19
What is COVID-19??
COVID-19?is?a disease?caused by a new strain of coronavirus. ‘CO’ stands for corona, ‘VI’ for virus, and
‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as ‘2019 novel coronavirus’ or ‘2019-nCoV.’
The COVID-19 virus is a new virus linked to the same family of viruses as Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS) and some types of common cold.
What are the symptoms of COVID-19??
Symptoms can include fever, cough and shortness of breath. In more severe cases, infection can cause
pneumonia or breathing difficulties. More rarely, the disease can be fatal. These symptoms are similar to
the flu (influenza) or the common cold, which are a lot more common than COVID-19. This is why testing
is required to confirm if someone has COVID-19.
How does COVID-19 spread??
The virus is transmitted through direct contact with respiratory droplets of an infected person (generated
through coughing and sneezing). Individuals can also be infected from and touching surfaces
contaminated with the virus and touching their face (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth). The COVID-19 virus may
survive on surfaces for several hours, but simple disinfectants can kill it.
Who is?most at risk??
We are learning more about how?COVID-19?affects people every day.??Older people, and people with
chronic medical conditions,?such as diabetes and heart disease,?appear to be more at risk of developing
severe symptoms.? As this is a new virus, we are still learning about how it affects children. We know it is
possible for people of any age to be infected with the virus, but so far there are relatively few cases of
COVID-19 reported among children. This is a new virus and we need to learn more about how it affects
children. The virus can be fatal in rare cases, so far mainly among older people with pre-existing medical
conditions.
What is the treatment for COVID-19??
There is no currently available vaccine for COVID-19. However, many of the symptoms can be treated
and getting early care from a healthcare provider can make the disease less dangerous. There are
several clinical trials that are being conducted to evaluate potential therapeutics for COVID-19.
How can the spread of COVID-19 be slowed down or prevented?
As with other respiratory infections like the flu or the common cold, public health measures are critical to
slow the spread of illnesses. Public health measures are everyday preventive actions that include:
? staying home when sick;
? covering mouth and nose with flexed elbow or tissue when coughing or sneezing. Dispose of
used tissue immediately;
? washing hands often with soap and water; and
? cleaning frequently touched surfaces and objects.
As we learn more about COVID-19 public health officials may recommend additional actions.
